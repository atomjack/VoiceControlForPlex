Specify if more than one match is found)\n\nFor playback:\nPause Playback\nResume Playback\nStop Playback\n\nSeeking:\nOffset 1 hour 15 minutes 30 seconds\nOffset 30 minutes 5 seconds\n(Any combination of hours, minutes, and/or seconds, in that order)\n(You may also use \'timecode\' instead of \'offset\')\n\nIf you don\'t have \&quot;Resume if in progress\&quot; checked, you can selectively resume by saying \&quot;Resume watching\&quot; instead of \&quot;Watch\&quot;\n\nYou can also specify a client by adding \&quot;on &lt;client name&gt;\&quot; to your spoken query.</string>
