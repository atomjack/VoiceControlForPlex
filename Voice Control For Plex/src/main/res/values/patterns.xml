    This pattern is the main pattern that will need to be matched in order for anything to be done. As you can see it is
    a quite complicated regular expression. Plugging it into https://www.debuggex.com/ should help you figure out how
    it is constructed.

    Offset pattern. This lets the user start with with "offset" or "timecode", followed by:
        any number followed by "hour(s)" or "minute(s)" or "second(s)", and optionally followed by:
        any number followed by "minute(s)" or "second(s)", and optionally followed by:
        any number followed by "second(s)"
    The ([0-9]+|two|to) pattern will most likely only need to be ([0-9]+) for other languages, as in English,
    the number 2 sounds the same as "to" and "two", so sometimes the Voice Recognition engine will confuse the
    number 2 with "to" or "two". If your language has numbers that sound exactly like other words that the
    Voice Recognition will sometimes mis-translate, please contact Chris Bellew as some further changes will need
    to be made to the code to accommodate this.

    The (hours?|minutes?|seconds?) means hour, with or without an s at the end (singular or plural), and the
    same for minutes and seconds (the | means "or").
